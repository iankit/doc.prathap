						<h6>what is</h6>
						<h1>Chiropractic ?</h1>
						<p>Chiropractic is a science, an art, and a philosophy that allows the body to function better by reducing interference on the nervous system. Using "Chiropractic Adjustments" (technique) to eliminate "Subluxations" (restricted vertebral segments) we are able to allow "Innate Intelligence" to help our bodies heal naturally.Innate Intelligence refers to the body's natural ability to heal itself. Our body is constantly replacing old, dead cells with new ones, without any extra help - it does this on its own! For example, when you cut yourself, blood comes out, then clots, then scabs over. You did not need to take medicine or get surgery to correct this! Chiropractic is a natural, conservative form of healthcare that neither introduces harmful chemicals to the body (medicines), nor does it open the body up to infections (surgeries). In fact, having a properly functioning nervous system improves your body's ability to fight illness. The brain sends signals to your body through the spinal cord. From the spinal cord, pairs of nerve roots exit to form major nerves, which go on to power all of the body's functions. Getting a Chiropractic Adjustment literally "turns the power on!"</p>

	                    <p class="opinion wrapper">"Dr Prat is a talented chiropractor – the best I have ever seen. Because of Dr. Prat, I finally found relief from the chronic back and body pain I had lived with for 10 years. Dr. Prat’s unique integrative approach and in depth understanding of how the body works made it possible for him to: identify the root causes of my pain; help me understand the steps that could be taken to fix my problems; and make me feel better than I have ever before. Dr. Prat is friendly, caring, knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with.<br>
	    				Dr Prat’s holistic understanding of how connected the different systems of the body are, allowed him to fix my back, neck and hip pain but also to help improve my overall health. By fixing my body structurally, I saw improvement in my digestion, and my menstrual cycle became regular for the first time in 8 months. I am so very grateful to be living pain free and in better health. Dr. Prat did more than just treat me. He enthusiastically worked WITH me to help me achieve optimal health. He gave me easy to follow exercises that could be done at home to compliment his treatments. His positive outlook and passion for his work made it easy for me to finally commit to helping myself. Dr. Prat inspired me to take better care of my health and to love my body. Thank you, Dr. Prat, for helping me discover what it feels like to live pain free."</p>

He was able to elicit responses and immediately modify his adjustment based on that.  Moreover, he explained everything he was doing very systematically and kept me at ease during the procedure.   Subsequent visits were excellent as well and he even gave me advice for some exercises to perform to reduce pain and improve mobility on an old knee injury that I mentioned was giving me trouble.  Dr. Prathap is an outstanding example of an expert in his field and I highly recommend his services."  </p>

His knowledge and professionalism are exceptional and not to mention his adjustments are above any expectations. He explains to you what he is doing and why it is being done.

He was very compassionate and empathetic towards my concerns and needs. He took the time to properly assess not only my back but everything from my nutrition, sleeping habits, stress levels and genetic predisposition to inheriting back problems. He took a very holistic approach to my care, making sure to include me in decisions made about my treatment plan and taking the time to explain everything to me. I informed him of my anxieties around getting adjusted, especially with regards to my neck. He took the time to ease my fears by talking me through each adjustment at each session and now I feel much calmer and confident in getting regular adjustments. He is an excellent Chiropractor and I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends.

	                    <p class="opinion wrapper">"I always thought of chiropractors as those health care practitioners that specialized in “back injuries". As a young, active person I was completely oblivious to the positive impacts a chiropractor could have on my overall health. I had been under the impression that if I ate the right things and exercised the right way, I would always be in great health. However, after I started a full-time, demanding job over the past 2 years, I began noticing aches and pains that were not evident before. My neck felt strained, my shoulders felt stiff and activities were more taxing on my body.<br>
	    				When I first visited Dr. Addageethala as a client, I had been skeptical. But after my very first session, I already began seeing improvements in the way I felt. Each session left me feeling rejuvenated. The strains and stiffness were much improved. Not only were the sessions helpful, but he taught me strategies and techniques to maintain good posture throughout the day at work and during activities that helped my overall feeling of well-being. He is professional and very knowledgable, he was able to answer any questions I had and provided me with relevant advice.</p>

	                    <p class="opinion wrapper">"Dr. Prat treated me for my TMJ (jaw) issues and my back problems. Since he treated me I haven't had any pain or tightness with my jaw or my back. His treatment helped me improve my posture, and my back and jaw pain are completely gone. I'm really glad I went to him."</p>

	                    </div>
	                    <p class="opinion wrapper">"The first injury I had Dr. Addageethala take a look at was a lower back injury sustained during a workout in December 2013.  It seemed like a minor injury at the time but progressed to the point where I was having pain every time I bent over or turned too sharply.  The injury was preventing me from leading an active lifestyle or even being comfortable at work.<br>
	    				When I finally made an appointment to see Dr. Addageethala I wasn’t sure what to expect.  However, he took the time and care to properly assess and diagnose my injury, as well as explain it to me in terms I could understand.  I really appreciated that Dr. Addageethala made me feel like I was a part of the healing process and treated every complaint I had with the utmost concern.  He worked on my back with a practiced hand and I saw results almost immediately.  I was back in the gym and running outdoors within weeks and felt 100% within a few months.<br>
	    				After he helped me with my back injury I continued to see Dr. Addageethala regularly for maintenance care.  I found the adjustments and soft tissue work to be invaluable in helping me maintain a strong, healthy body and preventing re-injury.  I would recommend Dr. Addageethala to any of my friends or family because the care I received was simply fantastic."</p>

	                    <p class="opinion wrapper">"I had the opportunity to shadow Dr.Prat in the summer of 2013. He always demonstrates genuine concern for his patients needs and goes out of his way to educate them about their conditions and provide them with appropriate tools to live healthy lives. He is very passionate and knowledgeable about his practice, and has taught me a great deal about the positive impact a chiropractor can have on ones overall health. I witnessed his patient’s progress through treatments and leave completely satisfied with their pain relief and a smile on their faces."</p>
